## Set up instructions

First of all, this is a JavaScript project that's distributed on [npmjs.org](https://npmjs.org) and
therefore uses JavaScript tooling based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with dependencies from npm.
You're going to need to have those things installed to contribute to this project.

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Create a branch
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `npm t && npm run build`. If everything works, then you're ready to make changes.
6. Run `npm run test:watch`. See that it's watching your file system for changes.
7. Make your changes and try to make the tests pass. If you can't or need help then commit what you have with `--no-verify` and make a PR
8. If you get things working, add your changed files with `git add` and run `npm run commit` to get an interactive prompt for creating a commit message that follows [our standards](https://github.com/stevemao/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/master/convention.md). You'll notice that there are git hooks in place which will run testing, linting, etc. (unless you commit with `--no-verify`).
9. Push your changes to your fork with `git push`
10. Create a pull request.
11. Iterate on the solution.
12. Get merged! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽŠ


## Opening issues
Open an issue to report bugs or to propose new features.

## Proposing pull requests

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Pull requests are very welcome. Note that if you are going to propose drastic changes, be sure to open an issue for discussion first, to make sure that your PR will be accepted before you spend effort coding it.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
